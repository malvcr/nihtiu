    <h1>Nihtiu Architecture</h1>
    <p>
      Nihtiu purpose is to control a ventilator type of medical equipment.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this control, Nihtui is defined as a three-level computing system:
      <ul>
        <li>Critical SubSystem (CS)</li>
        <li>Access SubSystem (AS)</li>
        <li>Processing SubSystem (PS)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Critical SubSystem (CS)</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="CSSubsystem.html">CS</a> is hosted in an Arduino based Microcontroled computing machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      This machine:
      <ul>
        <li>Executes all the critical procedures that keep the machine
            working without interruption.
        </li>
        <li>Query sensors and other physical devices that provide the
            needed information for the machine to work and to react to
            certain irregular events.
        </li>
        <li>Moves the physical parts that provide the artificial breathing
            to the patient.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Access SubSystem (AS)</h2>
    <p>
      This machine:
      <ul>
        <li>offers the user interface for the medical professional to check 
            and to control the system.
        </li>
        <li>collects telemetry information about operations and real time 
            data concerning to the patient the machine is helping to breath.
        </li>
        <li>offers an external API for other systems to obtain the telemetry
            data and to send remote commands to the system.
        </li>
      </ul>   
    </p>
    <h2>Processing SubSystem (PS)</h2>
    <p>
      This machine:
      <ul>
        <li>Acquires the data from one or more AS devices and process
            it to perform several -non-critical- functions.
        </li>
        <li>Could be used to send commands to the AS devices, for them
            to communicate orderly with their corresponding CS ones to
            perform specific tasks.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
