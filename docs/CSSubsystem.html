    <h1>Critical SubSystem (CS)</h1>
    <p>
      The CS is being worked to run using an Arduino Mega type of 
      microcontroller system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Could run in other Arduino type of machines, but that is not
         being tested in the main project.
      </i>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What this machine do is to produce <b><i>breathing cycles</i></b>, that
      are a medium to send air to a patient and to release that air in
      a controlled way.  So, there are many different events but they
      can't appear in the middle of any of these cycles (each cycle must
      finish according with the information the machine had before that
      cycle began).  The only exception is the "Hold" event, that stop
      the machine "before" the release internal operation is performed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As an Arduino system, it has been organized in the following 
      elements:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Actions:</b> : transactions performed on the system.
        <li><b>Modes:</b> : <i><b>ventilator modes</b></i>, basically the different types of working algorithms.
        <li><b>Sensors:</b> the elements that collect data.
        <li><b>Actuators:</b> the elements that perform actions.
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Together with a "shared" data structure known as its "context"
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>actions</b> are independent functions stored in a vector that
      are located by an index ( O(1) speed ).  The current defined actions
      are:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Continue</b>: work the next breath cycle.
        <li><b>ChangeBehaviour</b>: modifies one of the working parameters.
        <li><b>GetData</b>: obtain some setting or realtime data.
        <li><b>Reset</b>: return to the last "standard" working profile.
        <li><b>SetMode</b>: defines what will be the mode for the next breathing cycle.
        <li><b>StoreProfile</b>: creates a new profile and stores it in the Arduino EEPROM.
        <li><b>SetProfile</b>: loads and applies a previously stored profile.
        <li><b>Hold</b>: stops the machine until the hold line is cleared.
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      These instructions to perform the actions are received on the Serial Arduino line 
      from the AC (typically a Single Board Computer) connected through a USB cable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>modes</b> are the methodologies or algorithms the machine follow to achieve
      its goals.  They are corresponding to formal medical ventilator modes: 
      <ul>
        <li><b>ACV:</b> Assist-Control Ventilation
        <li><b>SIMV:</b> Synchronized Intermittent-Mandatory Ventilation
        <li><b>PCV:</b> Pressure-Controlled Ventilation
        <li><b>PSV:</b> Pressure Support Ventilation
        <li><b>PCIRV:</b> Pressure Controlled Inverse Ration Ventilation
        <li><b>APRV:</b> Airway Pressure Release Ventilation
        <li><b>PRVC:</b> Pressure Regulated Volume Control
        <li><b>PAV:</b> Proportional Assist Ventilation
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Take into consideration that not all these modes will be ready now, as this is a
      "work in progress".
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>sensors</b> collect certain runtime data and events.  Here we have:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Pressure Sensor:</b> Checks the current air pressure
        <li><b>Flow Sensor:</b> Checks the currently delivered air volume
        <li><b>Hold Button:</b> Identifies if a "hold" operation was requested locally
        <li><b>Reset Button:</b> Identifies if a "reset" operation was requested locally
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>actuators</b> are the ones performing the physical actions.  We have:
      <ul>
        <li><b>BigValveMask:</b> The bubble is used to accumulate and send air to the patient.
        <li><b>Alarm:</b> The mechanism used to advice the medical personal on particular
            warnings or emergencies.
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Possibly, the BigValveMask be one of these:

        <img src="images/Bag_valve_mask_2.jpg" width="200px"/>
      </center>
    <p>
      And what the actuator do is to press and release the bag in a controlled period
      of time and pause following different possible methods.  This is why Nihtui is not
      limited to any of them; who uses this control system must add the particular
      programming that controls how the bag is pressed and released.
    </p>
    <p>
      An option is to use a step-motor with a strap, as the original 
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FNPwrQjB1qW1330s5-S_-VB0vDHajMWKieJRjINCNeE/preview?fbclid=IwAR3ugu1SGMsacwKi6ycAKJFOMduInSO4WVM8rgmC4CgMJY6cKaGBNR14mpM">Botta</a>
      document
      describes.  A different one is following the Spanish <a href="https://www.oxygen.protofy.xyz/">Oxygen</a> project suggestion, using
      some paddle that press the bag.  In any case, the idea is to use all the data the
      controller offers to define how to use these physical elements to perform the
      specified task.
